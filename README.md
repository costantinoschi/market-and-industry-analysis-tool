# Market and Industry Analysis Tool

## Overview
This project is a **Market and Industry Analysis Tool** designed to analyze market trends and industry dynamics to identify attractive sectors. The tool integrates with external data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, PitchBook, Statista), visualizes market size and growth rates, and benchmarks target companies against industry peers.

The project is built using Python and leverages libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly** for data analysis and visualization.

## Features
1. **Data Integration**: Load and preprocess data from external sources.
2. **Market Analysis**: Analyze market size and growth rates.
3. **Industry Analysis**: Analyze competitive landscape and market share.
4. **Benchmarking**: Compare target companies against industry peers.
5. **Visualization**: Visualize market and industry analysis results.
